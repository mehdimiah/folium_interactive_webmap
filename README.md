# folium_interactive_webmap
Utilising the folium library, here I have created a webmap. 

This webmap displays location of volcano with pop up + links to the volcano information online.

I have also added a population density layer all of which can be switched on and off.

I lastly added a key to help further explain the contents of the webmapp.
